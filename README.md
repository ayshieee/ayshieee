I am a dedicated and passionate second-year Information Technology student at NU Laguna, proudly supported as an SM Scholar. I actively serve as a member of the School of Computer Studies - Student Council, contributing to a range of student-led initiatives.

As an engaged member of the NU community, I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals, exchange innovative ideas, and take part in projects that create meaningful impact. I am driven by a strong commitment to both personal development and collective success, and I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage growth and challenge me to exceed expectations.
